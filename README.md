# Get Of That Damn Island
*A puzzle game where you need to get your ship to the landing strip before the whole world is gone.*

This is achieved by pushing around blocks and using the destroying in your advantage. My very first game jam and i think i did pretty well, all the feedback is greatly appreciated.
